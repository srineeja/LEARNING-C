Write a program which does the following
Declare an integer variable i and initialise it to 0
Use the do/while loop to output i to the console as long as i is less than 6.

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {

  int i = 0;
  do{
    cout << i << endl;
    i = i+1;
  }
  while(i < 6);

  
}
